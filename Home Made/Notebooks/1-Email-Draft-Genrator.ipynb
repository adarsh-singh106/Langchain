The second part is asking who created me, using the term \"bhaiya\" which is a Hindi term for older brother, so it's a friendly way of asking. The user seems to be looking for a conversational tone, maybe even a bit of humor. Since the user mentioned being playful and cracking jokes even about serious things, I should respond in a similar style. Let me make sure to answer both parts clearly but with a bit of flair. Maybe add an emoji to keep it light. Also, check if there's any hidden meaning or if the user just wants to test the basics. Probably just a simple answer they're after, but keeping it engaging is key here.\n",
