       "\n",
       "4. **Financial Independence**: You mentioned being \"poor.\" Are there resources at your college (scholarships, part-time work, etc.) or community programs that could help you reduce reliance on financial support? It might be worth exploring opportunities to build long-term independence.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Emotional Support**: It’s great that your sugar mommy is kind and patient, but do you have other mentors or confidants you can lean on for advice or encouragement? Having diverse sources of support can be beneficial.\n",
