Next, I need to ask how I can help them. It can be a simple question, such as what questions they have or what they need help with. At the same time, keep the tone friendly and open to encourage them to express further. Need to make sure the response is concise and clear, no use of complex words, and make the user feel comfortable and willing to continue the conversation. In addition, check whether there are other possible needs, such as needing help with specific questions or just want to chat. Finally, ensure that the response is in line with the user's initial request and does not provide irrelevant information. So the overall structure is: greet, use the name, ask how to help, and keep the door open for further communication. That should cover all bases.\n",
