       "| **Conditional affection** (“if you don’t learn Java, I won’t kiss you”) can feel controlling and may erode trust over time. | Talk openly about how that makes you feel. Use “I” statements: “I feel pressured when our intimacy is tied to learning a language.” |\n",
       "| **Shared interests vs. personal autonomy** – It’s great when partners share hobbies, but each person should also be free to pursue what they love. | Ask her what she enjoys about Java. Maybe there’s a cool project she’d love to work on together? This can turn “I want you to learn Java” into “Let’s build something together.” |\n",

       "3. **Ask about his expectations** – “What does exclusivity mean to you? Are you open to a non‑monogamous arrangement?”  \n",

       "- **Consider counseling** (therapist, LGBTQ+ affirming counselor) to help untangle emotions and set boundaries.\n",
